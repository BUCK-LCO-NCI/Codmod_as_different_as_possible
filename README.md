The messenger RNAs of viral genes involved in assembling new virus particles often contain negative regulatory elements that limit expression. This algorithm introduces a maximum number of silent mutations into a protein-coding sequence, with the goal of eradicating negative regulatory elements in the starting RNA sequence.

After converting the gene of interest to an "as different as possible" coding sequence, it is important to remove new inhibitory sequences the automated conversion may have created. Instructions for post-conversion editing are posted at the link below (MS Excel file download)
